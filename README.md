# Kickstarter Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
To help Louise with an upcoming Kickstarter project, we decided to analyze a set of data from the intended crowdfunding site to optimize the likelihood that the project will succeed. We choose two starting variables that are easy to manipulate to attain easily actionable information then make tables and graphs to understand how the launch date and goal affected the likelihood of success.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The best way to look at the outcome based on start date is to use a line graph.

This allows us to easily se that although theatre has managed more successes than failures across the board, there are some months that were more consistently successful. May has the obvious lead and a success rate of more that 65%, making it the ideal month to start a theater Kickstarter. December, on the other hand, has barely more successes than failures and enough canceled projects to make the success rate less than 50%, making it a month to avoid. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The percentages of success rates based of the size of the goal in this subset of data render an interesting set of results and an actionable but not entirely logical bit of advice.

The most logical, and statistically proven, fact is that low goals are more easily meet. For goals under $5,000, we see the highest success rates at roughly 75%, but from $5,000 up to $20,000 that drops to nearly 50%. The odd and important fact can be seen just a little further down the line where the success percentage comes back up. Those Kickstarters with a goal greater than or equal to $35,000 and less than $45,000 attained a success rate of 67%, or 2/3. Therefore, in the most likely case that the desired outcome cannot be achieved with a goal of less than $5,000, the best option is to set the goal in the higher range. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Although I had not done any sort of similar data manipulation, all these processes were logical and therefore simple to grasp. My first challenge was that for the first week I worked on this, Excel would only filter on column at a time for me. That was easily overcome by copying the partially filtered information into a new sheet for further filtering. Thankfully, it has since resolved itself, unfortunately that means that I have no screenshot to corroborate that fact. The next difficulty I experienced was a simple logical oversight on my part when sorting the data by goal. I started typing the greater than and less than numbers without thinking and had to redo almost all of them. Hopefully, that experience will always remind me to, at least briefly, think through my logic before putting in twenty lines of code.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
May has the obvious lead and a success rate of more that 65%, making it the ideal month to start a theater Kickstarter. December, on the other hand, has barely more successes than failures and enough canceled projects to make the success rate less than 50%, making it a month to avoid. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
In the most likely case that the desired outcome cannot be achieved with a goal of less than $5,000, the best option is to set the goal greater than or equal to $35,000 and less than $45,000. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The number of data point, although originally an appealing 4,113, ends up supplying us with not quite 1,400 data points under the theater category, and that number is cut down more if we limit what country we look in or look at only the plays, while looking at musicals will five us a few hundred at best. This may not skew our statistics greatly, there are almost nine times that many Kickstarters under the theater category on their website. As with all data that is generated by human beings, there are going to be some that are difficult to interpret properly, like the human who decided to set their fundraising goal at $1 and ended up raising more than $22,000. Although that particular point was not in the subsets that we analyzed, there would be some equally odd data points in the hundreds we were focused on.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
The outcome sorted by date is for all projects in the category of theater, but with a small amount of manipulation, we can see that it is very similar to the graph that would be constructed from just plays, leading me to believe that it is indeed an accurate representation. The outcomes organized by goal, on the other hand, looks at only the musicals. I would recommend copying the computations for that sheet while looking at the plays, the entire theater category, or both, to gain a more complete understanding of how the goal interacts with the success rates in different subsets of our data.
